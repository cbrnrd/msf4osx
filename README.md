# msf4osx
Metasploit is usually intended to be run on a Linux system, but installing it on OS X is a huge pain in the ass. This makes it easier on you.
For this to run _properly_ , you should run it as root so everything installs correctly,

so type: `sudo python msf4osx.py` to start the script.

Have fun with Metasploit :)
